One of my passions is teaching, or rather, being able to help and inspire others in their learning, and I very much agree with the ideas in the blog post. To be able to impact more people, I must be willing to share what I've learned. I think many people, myself included, love seeing the process by which something is achieved; sharing what I'm learning is exactly that.",

In fact, this very goal of wanting to unify where I save my links/bookmarks for easy retrieval is why I decided to build this webpage for saving/sharing links.
