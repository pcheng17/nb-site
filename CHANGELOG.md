# Change Log

## v.1.3.1 - 2025-01-04

### New features

- Add `aria-label` to the anchor links for accessibility

## v.1.3.0 - 2025-01-02

### New features

- Added the ability to link directly to each week's listing, and also directly to each entry. This
is to allow for me and others to share links to locations on the page.
  - I generate slugs from the titles of each entry, but since titles may not be unique, I needed to
    incorporate de-duplication logic when forming the slugs.
- Added an extra little bit of metadata displaying how many entries are in each post
- Increased font sizes for readability, and adjusted margins accordingly

## v1.0.0 - 2024-12-30

Initial release, with the following features:

- Given a `data.json` file which contains urls that I'd like to save along with a description, `nb` will generate a simple webpage that displays the information.
- Entries are grouped by week, and entries ordered in reverse chronological order, i.e., the farther down you go, the older the links are in terms of when I saved them.
